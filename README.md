Notice how not only are the visuals great, but there are a lot of opportunities to be interactive with the data! This is super useful to give to teams or clients who want to be able to explore more on there own easily. 

Tableau can be incredbly powerful! And can be a super useful tool to have in your toolset as a Data Analyst, Busniess Intellgence Analyst, or Data Scientist. 

Keep in mind that this is just an intro course and we will only be scratching the surface what tableau is capable of. If you find it interesting keep learning! 

We have a part time Data Analytics class! you'll cover data analytics with Excel, SQL, and Tableau. The course also includes our Career Services support to help find a job. 


# Lets make things with Tableau!

We're going to look at 3 different datasets, and answer questions about them.

Tip: For these workshop we will be using data thats already in a good formatted, but when working with clients in the feild be prepared to do a lot of data cleaning / reformattig!
