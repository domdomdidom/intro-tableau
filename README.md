## Setup

Install [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)





## What is Data Analytics

### Common Analytic tools 

- Excel
- sql
- Data Visual tool (tableau, power BI)
- Python


Story telling with data

## What is Tableau
about tool

great for visualizing data and creating interactive dashboards.


Usually used for its Drag and drop approach to making visualizing data easier.


### Data Visuliation examples

Lets take a further look at some of the things you can make with tableau!

Checkout [tableau public Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery) for a bunch of awesome examples. This is also where your tableau files will get saved when you use Tableau Public. To save locally you need to purchase a lisence or have an education lisecence version.

Notice how not only are the visuals great, but there are a lot of opportunities to be interactive with the data! This is super useful to give to teams or clients who want to be able to explore more on there own easily. 

Tableau can be incredbly powerful! And can be a super useful tool to have in your toolset as a Data Analyst, Busniess Intellgence Analyst, or Data Scientist. 

Keep in mind that this is just an intro course and we will only be scratching the surface what tableau is capable of. If you find it interesting keep learning! 

Tableau has some great tutorials on their site

We have a part time Data Analytics class! you'll cover data analytics with Excel, SQL, and Tableau. The course also includes our Career Services support to help find a job. 


# Lets make things with Tableau!

For the next hour or so we're going to be Data Analysts! 

We have three clients that want answers about their data. 

We're going to look at 3 different datasets, and answer questions about them.

The city of Seattle wants to know understand how many bikes are going accross the Fremont Brige. And what time of the year is most popular. Can possbly shed some insight on why?

This project we will be using the [Fremont Bridge Data]()

https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k

A bike company

- Pronto Bikes Seattle
- Seattle Pet License



## Fremont Bridge

Thanks to [Seattle Open Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k) we can get the fremont Bride data set.

Launch Tableau!

### Connect to Data Source (Fremont)

The type of file is a Comma Seperated Value(CSV) Format. To open this in tableau under connect click `Text file`

![Connect CSV file](img/fremont/fremont_connect.png "Connect CSV file")


Navigate to where you saved the data file. And click open

![Connect CSV file](img/fremont/opendatafile.png "Connect CSV file")


You should now see a screen similar to this:

![Connect CSV file](img/fremont/datasource.png "Connect CSV file")


Notice the data in the bottom half of the screen that looks like an excel sheet. This is a good opportinuty to explore our data a bit before going further with the visualization.

We can see this dataset is failr simple. It only contains three columns. 

- The date and hour
- Number of bikes on East sidewalk
- Number of bikes on the west Sidewalk

After we're done looking at our data lets click on the `sheet 1` near the bottom left

![sheet 1](img/fremont/sheet1.png "sheet1")

You should see a screen like this:

![sheet 1](img/fremont/sheet.png "sheet1")


There are a lot of things going on here, lets may attention two parts right now:

- Columns and Rows

![sheet 1](img/fremont/colrows.png "sheet1")


- Data
- - Dimension 
- - Measure

![sheet 1](img/fremont/data.png "sheet1")

Since we know we want to visualize by month lets drag `Date` data into the columns section. If you've used excel to make charts before this probably makes sense, usually you can think of columns as going left to right. Rows usually are going from top to bottom.

Sheet Example:

Lets drag one of the sidewalk Measures into Rows

Change to month

Why Month/Date changes to Measure

drag other sidewalk data in

## Pronto Bikes Seattle
In a time before LimeBikes and Jump there was once a bike company called [Pronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronto_Cycle_Share) that inhabited Seattle. 

Our job as a Data Analyist is to figure out how many trips were take each month, and how to easily visulize those trips. What does the Trend of the number of rides per month look like?



### Importing Data (Pronto)

First we will need to import data. 

About data types

Multiple sources

You can can import multiple resources and make a join. We will go into this later. But for now lets look at our one dataset on Seattle Pets

Bring in a source of data:

- Select what type of data. In this case its excel(xls)


#### Explore your data (Pronto)

Know your data! before going too far into visulizing or manipulating data its helpful to try to understand whats going on in your data. What are the columns? Is the data in a good format?

Tip: For this workshop we will be using data thats already in a good formatted, but when working with clients in the feild be prepared to do a lot of data cleaning / reformattig!

##### explore inside Tableau ((Pronto)

We can look at our data directly inside tableau

### Challenge: Get to know your data!

Using the method described above, take a look at your data.
Think about some things we could get insights on. What colunms do you find the most interesting?
